# Photoamplifier (a device to measure radioactivity level)

**This project is unfinished.**

## Principle of operation

TODO

## System architecture

It is designed in a way that the device can work remotely, e.g. no connection via USB cable to userâ€™s PC is needed.

## Hardware

PCB was done in KiCAD.


## Software
* [Firmware compilation and hardware flashing
](https://github.com/RobertGawron/IonizationChamber/wiki/Firmware-compilation-and-hardware-flashing) 


## Hazards

* **The device exposes high voltage to user, although maximum current is limited, it still poses health risk if the sensor external electrode would be touch.**
