# HighVoltagePowerSupply

- All elements in Cockcroftâ€“Walton generator should be rated 150V or more.
- All resistors in voltage divider should be rated 150V or more and have the same temperature coefficient.
- op-amp should be input/output rail to rail, low noise, low input bias currents (e.g. [TS912IDT](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/ts912.pdf))
