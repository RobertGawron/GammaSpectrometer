# PhotomultiplierConnector

This board is used to:

- connect below components:
  - __photomultiplier tube__ and PCB of __data acquisition__,
  - __photomultiplier tube__ and PCB of __high voltage generator__,
- provide polarization for __photomultiplier tube__.

Polarization can be either positive or negative, on the PCB there are two sockets for photomultiplier tube. One is used in positive configuration, one is used in negative configuration. Only one should be used depends on configuration.

Components for polarization were placed automatically using tool located in ./PolarCoordinateComponentPlacer and **they shouldn't be moved manually**. Placements of those elements can be modified using mentioned tool.
